## 🎯 Core Drive Management Features
*   **🧹 Clean Hidden Drive Junk:** Automatically find and remove system-created hidden files (like `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, temporary files) from external drives, USB sticks, and network volumes to free up space.
*   **🚀 Safe Eject & Volume Management:** Eject any drive with a single click. CleanMyDrive ensures all data is written and processes are stopped, preventing "Drive not ejected properly" errors.
*   **🎨 Customize Drive Icons:** Easily change the icon of any mounted volume directly from the app's menu bar icon, making your drives visually distinct on the desktop or in Finder.

## About CleanMyDrive
CleanMyDrive is a specialized utility focused on the health and organization of external storage devices connected to your computer. Its primary mission is to combat "drive clutter"—the invisible junk files that operating systems scatter across removable media. For example, when a Mac writes `.DS_Store` files to a USB drive to remember folder views, or Windows leaves `Thumbs.db` files for thumbnails, these files waste space and can be a nuisance when transferring drives between different operating systems. CleanMyDrive efficiently scans and removes these files, ensuring your external storage is clean and contains only the files you intentionally put there.

Beyond cleaning, the app serves as a superior drive management hub. It lives conveniently in the menu bar, providing an instant overview of all mounted volumes, their used/free space, and a quick eject button for each. The ability to change drive icons is a simple but highly practical feature for visually organizing a workspace with many drives. Designed by MacPaw (the creators of CleanMyMac), CleanMyDrive shares the same ethos of combining powerful functionality with an exceptionally user-friendly and visually appealing interface. It’s an essential tool for photographers, videographers, IT professionals, and anyone who regularly uses external hard drives, SSDs, or USB flash drives.

*   **Freeing Up Space on Media Cards:** Cleaning SD cards and USB sticks used in cameras, drones, or audio recorders to maximize available storage for new projects.
*   **Maintaining Network-Attached Storage (NAS):** Removing platform-specific junk files from network drives accessed by both macOS and Windows computers to keep them tidy.
